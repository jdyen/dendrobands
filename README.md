## Overview
This directory contains code and data to reproduce analyses presented in Lada et al. (in prep.).

## About
There are two primary scripts for analyses:
dendroband_model_code.R: contains full code to fit a Bayesian hierarchical model in Stan and summarise parameters.
tree-size-projections.R: contains full code to project tree circumferences over multi-year climate sequences.

Data are not currently available with these code files but will be made available on publication.
